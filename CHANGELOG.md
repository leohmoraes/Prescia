# Changelog

All notable changes to the Prescia framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Added PHPUnit-based PHP 8.3 compatibility tests in `tests/Php83CompatibilityTest.php`.
- Added Composer project metadata and the `composer test` command.
- Added GitHub Actions validation for PHP 8.3, required extensions and Docker build in `.github/workflows/php83.yml`.
- Added the prioritized security remediation plan in `docs/PLANO_ACAO_SEGURANCA.md`.
- Added the conservative migration helper in `tools/migrate_php83.php`, with dry-run, timestamped backups and a security blocker report.

### Changed
- Completed the CKFinder review cycle: merged image-input hardening (#140), malformed `CopyFiles` input validation and callback regressions (#141), and centralized resource/thumbnail path containment (#142); remaining PHP4, CSRF, ACL, active-content and TOCTOU work remains tracked in issue #67.
- Hardened CKFinder `RenameFolder` by validating the destination thumbnail path and preserving the source thumbnails when the secondary rename fails; added regression coverage for the containment and non-destructive failure contract.
- Added fail-closed, versioned SSRF security events to `loadURL()`, with stable rejection reasons and redacted/truncated host metadata that never includes query strings, credentials or remote response bodies.
- Limited `loadURL()` DNS processing to bounded record and public-IP counts, failing closed before connection attempts when a response exceeds the resource budget.
- Removed the remaining generic `fetch()`/`query()` fallbacks from the central module content path; structured and legacy raw SQL inputs now use the prepared execution API even when no values are bound.
- Continued the PHPStan level-2 remediation by making date arithmetic explicitly numeric and guarding cache-control normalization against a zero time range.
- Parameterized the selected page filter in the bi_stats module report while keeping table and column identifiers derived from validated module metadata.
- Added centralized allowlisted HTML sanitization with safe link-scheme filtering and regression coverage for scripts, event handlers, and `javascript:` URLs.
- Corrected Docker documentation to match the PHP 8.3 image and the removal of short-tag requirements; full compatibility tests and PHPStan remain green.
- Migrated the remaining bi_undo notification consumer from legacy `getKeys()` to the prepared key contract, including explicit parameter metadata initialization.
- Added a PHP 8.3 CI MySQL service and an integration regression covering prepared INSERT/SELECT CRUD with quotes, backslashes, Unicode, NULL, and injection-shaped values.
- Extended the MySQL integration suite to exercise `CDBO_mysqli` output initialization for empty results and failed prepared queries.
- Migrated the `bi_undo` storage-directory bootstrap from the global `safe_mkdir()` helper to the typed `FileService`.
- Continued PHPStan level-2 remediation with explicit numeric coercions in the administrative edit and list payloads; the exploratory residual decreased from 34 to 28 diagnostics without changing the baseline.
- Added explicit float coercions for PHP upload-limit parsing in `bi_dev`; the exploratory level-2 residual is now 26 diagnostics.
- Started the systematic CKFinder security remediation: documented 11 findings across PHP5/PHP4 connectors, upload callbacks, active-content policy, filesystem races, ACLs, image processing and CSRF; the first corrective batch validates image resize inputs, rejects invalid image metadata and blocks direct watermark-plugin inclusion.
- Parameterized remaining `bi_stats` counters and `bi_fm` file-name filters, then migrated the remaining `bi_dev` and `bi_cms` database operations to prepared execution.
- Completed prepared execution for the remaining `bi_stats` analytics ranking, browser, resolution, bot and language queries.
- Replaced remaining fixed-window analytics summary queries and page-title lookup in `bi_stats` with prepared execution.
- Replaced interpolated page and date filters in the `bi_stats` path analytics endpoint with prepared queries.
- Replaced interpolated alias and language filters in `bi_seo` with prepared queries.
- Replaced concatenated `bi_stats` maintenance and daily aggregation reads/inserts with prepared queries.
- Replaced concatenated general hit, acceptance and returning-visitor counters in `bi_stats` with prepared queries.
- Replaced concatenated referer statistics reads, inserts and updates in `bi_stats` with prepared queries.
- Replaced concatenated realtime and navigation-path counters in `bi_stats` with prepared queries.
- Replaced concatenated administrator and bot counters in `bi_stats` with prepared queries.
- Replaced concatenated browser telemetry reads and counters in `bi_stats` with prepared queries.
- Unified generic `getContents()` reads on the prepared execution path, including structured queries without bound values.
- Updated generic backup export to build its full-table read through the structured SQL-array contract and prepared execution path.
- Parameterized numeric ID lookups in the generic module content path and added a regression test; remaining free-form generic SQL callers stay tracked by #94.
- Updated generic delete notifications to obtain module keys through `getPreparedKeys()` instead of the legacy `getKeys()` contract.
- Replaced the remote ownership SQL assembled through `getRemoteKeys()` with metadata-derived field selection and prepared value parameters via `getRemotePreparedKeys()`.
- Replaced the guest-group lookup and direct ownership read in `bi_auth` with prepared queries and `getPreparedKeys()`.
- Routed the remaining `bi_auth` bootstrap group and user existence reads through the prepared SQL-array executor, with regression coverage and no bound values.
- Replaced the administrative history link lookup with `getRemotePreparedKeys()` and `queryPrepared()`, preserving metadata-derived identifiers and ambiguous-link handling.
- Routed both administrative export read modes through `queryPrepared()` with explicit empty parameter metadata.
- Routed the administrative AJAX monitor count through the prepared SQL-array executor, matching the main dashboard monitor path.
- Parameterized administrative reorder selection IDs with integer validation, placeholders, and an `IN (NULL)` empty-selection guard.
- Removed the remaining raw `query()`/`fetch()` fallbacks from the administrative listing selection and linker-count paths.
- Replaced concatenated post-edit success/error lookups with a shared prepared-ID helper and preserved multiple-edit logging behavior.
- Parameterized selected keys in the `bi_labels` print path with metadata-aware integer/string types.
- Parameterized friendly URL action and request-derived query filters while preserving configured declarative filters.
- Routed `fullSearch()` structured module queries through the prepared executor without changing declarative search behavior.
- Replaced interpolated forum, language and callback filters in the `bi_bb` index payload with prepared parameters while preserving forum trees and latest-thread pagination.
- Added prepared-parameter transport to parental `getContents()` trees and migrated the selected-value markers in administrative edit and options payloads away from SQL interpolation.
- Replaced the legacy raw SQL string used to load `bi_bb` thread posts with a structured SQL array and prepared forum/thread identifiers, preserving joins, ordering and pagination behavior.
- Replaced the free-form SQL filters accepted by `mod_bi_bb::getTags()` and `getArchieveDates()` with metadata-validated equality filters and prepared query parameters; added a security regression test and preserved the PHPStan baseline.
- Parameterized administrative import link lookups and related-option filters, including selected values and prerequisite fields, while preserving metadata-derived identifiers.
- Parameterized the `bi_bb` inbox message count and the administrative edit key filters, including single-key and multi-selection paths, with regression coverage for recipient, date and `IN` values.
- Replaced the legacy `eval()` used to encode ZIP DOS timestamps with deterministic little-endian `pack()` serialization, and added regression coverage for the generated local file header.
- Hardened `bi_stats` CSV export with structured `fputcsv()` rows, date validation, numeric field typing, `nosniff`, and no-store response headers.
- Hardened CKFinder upload name collision handling by reserving destination paths with exclusive creation before moving the uploaded file, preventing concurrent uploads from selecting the same name.
- Normalized CKFinder upload extensions before image-content validation so uppercase image suffixes cannot bypass the configured `getimagesize()` check.
- Hardened CKFinder production configuration by disabling displayed PHP errors and reducing default file and directory modes from world/group-writable `0775` to `0640` and `0750`.
- Hardened CKFinder upload callbacks against ambiguous array parameters, added no-store and nosniff response headers, and rejected multi-file `$_FILES` payloads in the single-upload command.
- Hardened `bi_stats`: validated browser resolution values and moved `setres` queries to prepared statements; restricted the realtime statistics endpoint to administrators, validated IP input, and escaped persisted output.
- Hardened CKFinder copy and move operations by publishing copies through same-directory temporary files and replacing move targets atomically, avoiding destructive pre-unlink and partially written destinations.
- Hardened CKFinder upload input handling by validating the complete `$_FILES` structure, upload error codes, non-negative size, and `is_uploaded_file()` before reading or processing the temporary file.
- Hardened CKFinder P0/P1 upload and download paths with active-MIME rejection, canonical destination containment, safe RFC 6266-style download names, restrictive upload chmod, positive resource-type allowlists, and corrected denied-extension parsing.
- Hardened CKFinder downloads and upload callbacks: canonicalized download paths, rejected CR/LF header injection, added `nosniff`, and encoded JavaScript callback values with JSON hex escaping.
- Hardened CKFinder PHP5 mutable file handlers with canonical path containment checks that resolve existing symlinks and validate parents for new paths before copy, move, rename, delete and folder creation operations.
- Officialized the retirement of the CKFinder PHP4 runtime: the entrypoint now rejects PHP versions below 5, the connector always uses the PHP5-compatible implementation, and the legacy fallback is no longer selected.
- Hardened input-driven SQL paths: remote-key filters, AJAX filters, administrative reference selection, forum IDs and group IDs now use typed values or prepared statements.
- Hardened file-manager paths against traversal: raw delete filenames are no longer used as a fallback, directory inputs are allowlisted, and safe-file checks resolve canonical paths to prevent `..` and symlink escapes.
- Audited AJAX and administrative payloads for safety-flag bypasses; the import route now restores the previous safety state after `ignoreErrors` processing.
- Hardened the AJAX API routes: uniqueness checks now enforce field allowlists, SELECT permission checks and prepared values without exposing SQL errors; dependent-select queries retain RBAC safety enforcement instead of disabling it.
- Parameterized the authenticated login history and preferences update in `bi_auth`, removing serialized session data and the user ID from SQL string interpolation.
- Parameterized the `bi_bb` forum preview lookups, removing direct `$_POST` interpolation from both thread and forum queries; added a regression test for the protected path.
- Updated the Docker image from PHP 8.2 to PHP 8.3.
- Added the `mbstring` extension to the Docker image.
- Documented PHP 8.3 requirements and compatibility test commands in `README.md`.
- Updated PHPStan to the 2.x series and raised the initial analysis level to 1.
- Documented the incremental analysis policy: the baseline must not grow automatically and new diagnostics require remediation or an issue.
- Started typing the central component contracts, including `CModule`, authentication, cache, error, header, internationalization and scripted-module properties.
- Fixed PHP 8.3 compatibility-test file discovery by resolving the repository root and filtering excluded directories relative to that root.
- Fixed legacy `<?php/*` headers in framework libraries so PHP 8.3 and PHPStan parse and load them as PHP instead of emitting their source as plain text.
- Initialized legacy database query result variables before calls across core, lazy-loading and plugin flows, and fixed image/template typos involving `$im_dest`, `$minuatura` and `$str_daylabels`.
- Started explicit payload context contracts for `$core` and `$this` in the `bi_adm` and `bi_stats` payloads using PHPDoc annotations that document the framework-injected `CPrescia` and `CModule` contexts.
- Started the undefined-variable remediation batch by initializing prepared-query result handles in `CModule` and correcting the `$code`/`$valor` parameter typos in `CintlControl`.
- Started the legacy-symbol remediation batch by adding precise PHPStan stubs for `dieFreakingThumbs()`, `adodb_daylight_sv()` and the dynamically instantiated `CDBO_0` driver class.
- Aligned the seven PHPStan-reported child properties in `bi_adm`, `bi_bb`, `bi_dev`, `bi_labels` and `bi_undo`; `admFolder` now explicitly models its runtime string/list lifecycle.
- Corrected Lote D method contracts: preserved CKTemplate's legacy fourth constructor argument, removed the obsolete second `runclasses()` argument, aligned `checkPermission()` calls to three parameters, corrected `checkHTML()` usage, and separated duplicate nested action-log helpers.
- Started Lote E by adding generic array contracts to the procedural helpers `arrayToString()`, `extractUri()`, `listFiles()`, `xmlParamsParser()` and `adodb_daylight_sv()`, including their PHPStan stubs.
- Officialized Lote F as the controlled PHPStan baseline-review stage, with regression safeguards, mandatory metrics and a two-cycle stability gate before level 2.
- Expanded Lote F with an operational strategy for the current `1000+` diagnostic report, prioritizing undefined variables, validating object contracts and prohibiting baseline additions for regressions.
- Started Fase F1 by initializing database result handles and row counts in authentication, session, user-loading and integration-test flows without changing query success semantics.
- Completed the Fase F2 third-cycle payload contract corrections: core state in `bi_stats` and `bi_adm` now uses the injected parent/core object, and `bi_auth` no longer references undeclared module properties for the action and translation keys.
- Started Fase F2 by changing CDBO connection state to protected for legitimate driver inheritance and correcting invalid authorization references to module fields and ownerLink.
- Started the second Fase F2 cycle by declaring CPresciaVar::$headerControl, specializing payload PHPDocs to concrete plugin modules and exposing the legitimately consumed bi_adm::$hasStats state as protected.
- Executed the PHPStan analysis for Fase F2 cycle three; the CI formatter exposed 1,000 diagnostics, including 962 `variable.undefined` records and the remaining module-property contract targets documented in the PHPStan plan.
- Started the current Fase F2 property-visibility cycle by replacing direct payload access to `mod_bi_adm::$hasStats` and `$hasUndo` with explicit public read methods, preserving the module's private/protected state. The two affected administrative payloads pass focused PHPStan analysis.
- Started Fase F3 by correcting the `bi_stats` content payload to call `loadAllmodules()` and `loaded()` on the injected `CPrescia` core instead of the `mod_bi_stats` module. The payload now passes focused PHPStan analysis and PHP 8.3 syntax validation.
- Continued Fase F3 in `bi_adm/module.php` by correcting the case of the core call from `loadAllModules()` to the declared `loadAllmodules()` method. No method diagnostics remain in the focused output; unrelated undefined-variable and inner-function diagnostics remain assigned to separate batches.
- Started Fase F4 by isolating the dynamically selected database driver contract in `tools/phpstan-dynamic-classes.php`. The explicit `CDBO`/`CDBO_0` constructor hierarchy is loaded through `scanFiles`, removing the `class.notFound` diagnostics for `CDBO_0` without loading a production connector or expanding the baseline.
- Started Fase F5 by hardening `prescia/lazyload/botprotect.php` against empty crawler regex configuration. Empty blacklist/whitelist patterns now become a non-matching safe pattern before `preg_match()`, eliminating both `regexp.pattern` diagnostics without changing configured pattern behavior.
- Refactored the two recursive local `removeNull()` functions in `bi_cms` into scoped recursive closures. This removes the associated `function.inner` and `function.notFound` diagnostics without introducing global functions; only the preexisting payload-context diagnostic remains in the focused file.
- Documented the injected `CPrescia` contracts for `feedReader.php`, `fullSearch.php` and the `bi_labels` configuration action, removing 18 PHPStan undefined-variable diagnostics without expanding the baseline.
- Added the real `CDBO` and `CDBO_mysqli` driver files to PHPStan discovery and kept `CDBO_0` as the explicit dynamic subclass contract. The focused driver analysis now reports no `property.notFound` diagnostics for inherited connection, logging, timing or query state.
- Started the undefined-variable remediation batch in `bi_bb` by documenting the injected `CPrescia`/`mod_bi_bb` payload context and correcting pagination state from module-local `$templateParams` to `$core->templateParams`. The `index.php` payload now passes focused PHPStan with no errors.
- Continued the undefined-variable remediation in `prescia/lazyload/friendlyurl.php` by documenting its real `CPrescia::friendlyurl(array $param)` include contract. The focused analysis now passes with no errors, without inventing defaults for matching parameters.
- Continued the undefined-variable remediation in `prescia/lazyload/fastclose.php` by documenting the `CPrescia::fastClose($action, $context)` include contract. The focused analysis now passes with no errors.
- Reworked missing-path handling in both entrypoints and the legacy CKEditor loader. Configuration, database connector and CKEditor implementation paths are now calculated, checked with `is_file()` and reported through explicit `RuntimeException`s before inclusion. This removes the PHPStan `require.fileNotFound` and `includeOnce.fileNotFound` diagnostics without adding production placeholder files.
- Initialized the `index.php` output buffer before the `servingFile` branch so `$PAGE` is defined on every path before plugin hooks, error output, honeypot injection, compression and final echo. The focused PHPStan analysis now reports no errors for the entrypoint.
- Started the grouped undefined-variable batch by documenting the injected `CPrescia`/`mod_bi_bb` context in `bi_bb/payload/content/preview.php`. Its 26 context diagnostics are resolved and focused PHPStan now reports no errors.
- Hardened mutable request handling with session-cookie flags, CSRF validation and rotation, production-safe debug handling, logout session invalidation, secure persistent-login cookies and stricter password migration.
- Replaced predictable activation codes and unsafe serialized-object handling, validated uploads by structure, extension and content, and added regression coverage for CSRF, password hashes, serialization and uploads.
- Parameterized the affected statistics and administrative SQL statements, restricted administrative mutations to POST, fixed ownership analysis scope in `bi_auth`, and removed PHP 8.3 `continue`-in-`switch` warnings from administrative payloads.
- Reworked the Docker and CI defaults to keep application code root-owned, isolate development bind mounts, use the committed Composer lockfile and run blocking PHPStan/lint checks. The current working-tree validation reports 219 global PHPStan diagnostics, while the treated files pass focused analysis.
- Completed the `prescia/lazyload/tcaptcha.php` context batch by documenting the `CPrescia::tCaptcha(string $key, bool $checkStage)` include contract. All 12 `variable.undefined` diagnostics were removed; focused PHPStan and PHP 8.3 syntax validation pass.
- Completed the first Issue #47 priority batch: initialized guarded date-conversion state in `datetime.php`, documented the injected `CPrescia` context in `bi_labels/config_labels.php` and `presciatester/_config/config.php`, and removed 35 PHPStan diagnostics without changing the baseline.
- Completed the second Issue #47 priority batch: documented the `CPrescia::rss()` include contract, corrected RSS array-count validation, fixed the `CImporter` class case, corrected enum field indexing, and initialized import fallback state. The batch removed 20 PHPStan diagnostics without changing the baseline.
- Completed the third Issue #47 priority batch by documenting the injected `CPrescia` context in the `bi_labels` content payload and the `bi_fm` permission action. The batch removed 17 context diagnostics without changing the baseline.
- Completed the fourth Issue #47 priority batch by documenting the injected `CPrescia` context in the project-template configuration, the Prescia contact action and the presciatester default content. The batch removed 21 context diagnostics without changing the baseline.
- Completed the fifth Issue #47 priority batch: initialized MIME boundaries in `sendMail.php`, documented the plugin-loading context in `bi_undo`, and initialized query/key fallback state. The batch removed 14 diagnostics without changing the baseline.

### Compatibility checks
- The compatibility suite checks runtime version, required extensions, PHP syntax, removed/deprecated APIs, short tags and Docker base image.
- The suite is intentionally blocking while known legacy constructs remain; passing the suite is required before declaring PHP 8.3 compatibility.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-02-20

### Breaking Changes
- **PHP 8.0+ Required**: Minimum PHP version requirement updated from PHP 5.4+ to PHP 8.0+
- **MySQL Extension Removed**: The deprecated `mysql` extension driver has been removed. Only `mysqli` is now supported.

### Changed
- Updated PHP version requirement from PHP 5.4+ to PHP 8.0+ in `/index.php`
- Updated database connector configuration to only support `mysqli` in `/config/settings.php.original`
- Replaced deprecated `each()` function with `foreach` in `/prescia/lib/_mqgpc.inc.php`
- Replaced deprecated `ereg()` function with `preg_match()` in `/prescia/plugins/bi_adm/payload/actions/import.php`

### Removed
- **Deprecated MySQL Driver**: Removed `/prescia/lib/dbo/mysql.php` as it used the deprecated `mysql_*` functions that were removed in PHP 7.0

### Security
- The framework continues to use the following security measures:
  - **Input Sanitization**: `cleanString()`, `cleanHTML()`, and `addslashes_EX()` functions for SQL injection and XSS prevention
  - **Bot Protection**: Honeypot links, crawler whitelist/blacklist, rate limiting, and IP-based temporary banning
  - **Authentication**: Master override password system, session-based access control
  - **HTML Filtering**: Regex-based dangerous tag removal (script, form, iframe, etc.)

### Notes
- All deprecated PHP 5.x and PHP 7.x functions have been updated for PHP 8+ compatibility
- The framework now requires `mysqli` extension for database connectivity
- Short tags (`<?`) are still required for this version
- UTF-8 encoding remains mandatory

### Migration Guide

#### For Existing Installations

1. **Update PHP Version**: Ensure your server is running PHP 8.0 or higher
   ```bash
   php -v
   ```

2. **Update Configuration**:
   - Edit your `config/settings.php` file
   - Ensure `CONS_AFF_DATABASECONNECTOR` is set to `"mysqli"`
   - Remove any references to `"mysql"` connector

3. **Enable MySQLi Extension**: Verify mysqli is enabled
   ```bash
   php -m | grep mysqli
   ```

4. **Test Your Installation**:
   - Access your Prescia installation
   - Check error logs in `_temp/_logs/` for any compatibility issues
   - Test database connectivity through admin panel

#### Breaking Changes Impact

**MySQL Extension Removal**:
- If you were using `CONS_AFF_DATABASECONNECTOR = "mysql"`, you must change it to `"mysqli"`
- The mysqli driver has been supported since the beginning and offers better performance
- No database schema changes are required

**PHP 8.0+ Requirement**:
- Deprecated functions (`each()`, `ereg()`) have been replaced
- Code is now compatible with PHP 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3
- Improved type safety and error handling

### Recommendations

1. **Database**: Continue using MySQLi driver with prepared statements for enhanced security
2. **Error Reporting**: Keep `CONS_AFF_ERRORHANDLER` enabled in production
3. **Caching**: Utilize the built-in cache system for optimal performance
4. **Security**: Review and update `CONS_MASTERPASS` and `CONS_MASTERMAIL` in settings
5. **Monitoring**: Check performance logs regularly in `_temp/_logs/pm.log`

### Known Issues

- Short tags (`<?`) are still required and must be enabled in php.ini
- Some legacy code patterns remain from the original 2004 codebase
- Framework is optimized for Apache; IIS requires additional configuration

### Future Considerations

- Consider migrating to full `<?php` tags instead of short tags for better compatibility
- Evaluate moving from regex-based HTML filtering to a modern sanitization library
- Consider implementing PDO as an alternative to mysqli for database abstraction
- Add comprehensive unit testing infrastructure

Applied the `phpstan-legacy-remediation` skill to `prescia/lazyload/readfile.php`. Confirmed `CPrescia::readfile($file, $ext, $exit, $filename, $forceAttach, $cachetime)` as the dynamic loader and documented all injected parameter contracts plus `CPrescia $this`. Focused PHPStan and PHP 8.3 syntax validation pass with no errors; the current global diagnostic count decreased from 325 to 311.
Applied the `phpstan-legacy-remediation` skill to `pages/prescia/_config/config.php`. Confirmed that `CPrescia` requires the site configuration from `CPrescia::loadDomain()` and documented the injected `CPrescia $this` context.

Focused PHPStan and PHP 8.3 syntax validation pass with no errors; the current global diagnostic count decreased from 299 to 287.
- Recorded the latest PHPStan global milestone in `docs/RELATORIO_PHPSTAN_PROGRESSO.md` and `docs/PLANO_PHPSTAN_PROXIMO_LOTE.md`: the level-1 repository analysis now reports **287 diagnostics**, down from 299 after the `ajaxQuery.php` remediation. Focused validation remains green for the corrected files, while the baseline remains unchanged.
- Analyzed and planned the next structural PHPStan batch for the 46 `return.missing` diagnostics in `tools/phpstan-framework-stubs.php`. The diagnostics come from empty stub bodies with non-void declarations; the planned remediation will add side-effect-free sentinel returns in waves, preserve the public signatures, keep the three `void` stubs unchanged and avoid baseline expansion.
- Added the detailed inventory of the 82 remaining PHPStan diagnostics, separating dynamic `$this`/`$core` contracts, manifest `$sname` flows, local variables and structural symbol diagnostics without expanding the baseline.
- Documented and remediated the six remaining BI module `$this` context diagnostics in `bi_bb`, `bi_cms`, `bi_groups`, `bi_seo` and `bi_stats`, based on the confirmed `CPrescia::addPlugin()` loader contract.
- Completed the BI module context sub-batch and initialized the `bi_bb` template frame, reducing the global PHPStan report from 82 to 75 diagnostics while keeping the baseline unchanged.
- Documented the `CPrescia` context in the `bi_labels` label-test payload and the unique-query AJAX lazyloader, reducing the global PHPStan report from 75 to 65 diagnostics.
- Documented the `$sname` manifest context in the BI Auth, Labels, Permissions and Stats plugins, reducing the global PHPStan report from 65 to 58 diagnostics without baseline changes.
- Documented the BI Stats AJAX core context and the administrative manifest `$sname` context, reducing the global PHPStan report from 58 to 53 diagnostics without baseline changes.
- Corrected `coreFull.php` variable flows and replaced the nested recursive `dieFreakingThumbs()` function with a closure, reducing the global PHPStan report from 53 to 48 diagnostics without baseline changes.
- Documented the `CPrescia` context in the default action/content payloads for `presciatester` and `prescia`, reducing the global PHPStan report from 48 to 38 diagnostics without baseline changes.
- Remediated the page reference, CLS lazyloader and `ttree` diagnostics, exposing the legitimately used `builddomains()` API and reducing the global PHPStan report from 38 to 28 diagnostics without baseline changes.
- Remediated the administrative and label payload batch, correcting conditional initializations, importer class casing and invalid-module flow, reducing the global PHPStan report from 28 to 15 diagnostics without baseline changes.
- Completed PHPStan Level 1 remediation: global analysis now reports 0 diagnostics, with PHP 8.3 lint and the full PHPUnit suite passing; the baseline remains unchanged.
- Documented the post-merge verification of PR #58: Composer validation, 23 PHPUnit tests/2745 assertions, zero PHPStan diagnostics, PHP 8.3 lint across 348 files, clean baseline and clean working tree.
- Started the next security remediation after PR #58: migrated CRUD key predicates, upload rollback/flags, generated URLs and composite-key ID lookup to prepared statements, with the baseline unchanged.
- Parameterized `autoPrune()` selection/update queries and parental-cycle lookups, preserving composite-key behavior and PHP 8.3 compatibility.
- Parameterized `CPrescia::deleteAllFrom()` UPDATE and cascade SELECT queries, removing key-value interpolation from cascading relationship cleanup.
- Parameterized group-level authorization lookups in the `bi_groups` plugin for update and delete actions.
